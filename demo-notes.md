What is devops

DevOps For Dummies
http://www.ibm.com/ibm/devops/us/en/resources/dummiesbooks/

 In
broad terms, DevOps is an approach based on lean and agile
principles in which business owners and the development,
operations, and quality assurance departments collaborate to
deliver software in a continuous manner that enables the business
to more quickly seize market opportunities and reduce
the time to include customer feedback. Indeed, enterprise
applications are so diverse and composed of multiple technologies,
databases, end-user devices, and so on, that only a
DevOps approach will be successful when dealing with these
complexities.

 DevOps as a business-driven software
delivery approach — an approach that takes a new or enhanced
business capability from an idea all the way to production, providing
business value to customers in an efficient manner and
capturing feedback as customers engage with the capability.
To do this, you need participation from stakeholders beyond
just the development and operations teams. A true DevOps
approach includes lines of business, practitioners, executives,
partners, suppliers, and so on.

How
 Develop and test against production-like systems
 ✓ Deploy with repeatable, reliable processes

CI
Early/Fequent and Offten
vs waiting until the end

discover issues earlier/sooner
isolate/localize issues - fix defect vs attempt to reproduce and hunt for issue.

Collaborative development, generally among teams but practices can be applied to personal projects.
