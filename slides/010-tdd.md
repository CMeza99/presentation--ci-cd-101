## Benefits

* More Reliable Code
* Maintain Project Scope
* Reduces Risk

<aside class="notes">
* Compents can be validated when created or modified
* Focus to pass test (which is spec/requirment)
* Increased confidence in Code / Process as software requirements can be assured, bugs can be caught as they are introduced; all of which lends to a more maintable code base

### Red Green Refactor

<aside class="notes">
* Write test
  * and verify it fails to ensure it is not mistakingly passing
* Write code to pass test
* Improve code
* Repeat

## Test-driven development cycle

* Add Test
* Run Test
* Write Code
* Run Test
* Refactor
* Repeat

<aside class="notes">
* Write test to specification / expect behavior
* Verify test does not mistakenly pass
* Only write code to satisfy test
* Verify code satisfies test
* Cleanup, optimize, improve code
* Add new test/specification
